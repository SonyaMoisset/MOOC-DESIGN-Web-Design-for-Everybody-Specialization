# Web Design for Everybody Specialization
##Advanced Styling with Responsive Design
### About the Course:
It used to be the case that everyone viewed webpages on about the same size screen.  But with the explosion of the use of smartphones to access the Internet, the landscape of design has completely changed.  People viewing your site will now expect that it will perform regardless of the platform (smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer).  This ability to respond to any platform is called responsive design.

This course will expand upon the basic knowledge of CSS3 to include topics such as wireframes, fluid design, media queries, and the use of existing styling paradigms such as Bootstrap.  After the course, learners will be able to:
- Explain the mobile-first paradigm and the importance of wireframes in the design phase
- Create sites that behave across a range of platforms
- Utilize existing design frameworks such as Bootstrap
